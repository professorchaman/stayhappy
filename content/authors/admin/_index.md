Hey! Oh so you are reading this. Interesting! I'm just doing experiment with this website creation tool. I believe that it's good to have a showcase about yourself. Just making sure people know about me.
On other regular days, I am a graduate student in the Pauzuaskie Research Group, and Novosselov Research Group at University of Washington. There is nothing better than science and mathematics in this whole wide world. These two control the whole universe, and possibly even the thing beyond it. So I'm a huge fan and follower of it.
You like them too? Great. Let's talk about them, and confess our love for the brillance of science and maths.
PS: The website is very much under-construction and this is the first draft. So maybe check back later. I'll try to have more funny stuff next time.
